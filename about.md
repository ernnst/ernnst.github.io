My name is Ernestas.

I work as Site Reliability Engineer at [Vinted](https://vinted.com) where I solve infrastructure problems with code.

Before that, I worked as System Administrator at [Wix](https://wix.com) and Network Administrator at [VMU](https://www.vdu.lt/en).

In this blog, I am sharing my opinion and knowledge about personal and work projects. The main goal is to document my learnings and mistakes so others can benefit from them.

Follow me on <a href="https://twitter.com/{{ site.author.twitter }}" target="_blank">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://github.com/{{ site.author.github }}" target="_blank">GitHub</a> for more updates.
