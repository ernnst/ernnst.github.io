Recently I have started working as a Site Reliability Engineer at [Vinted](https://vinted.com). For the first time in my career I am working with production infrastructure and that brings me lot's of new challenges.

I have decided to re-start my blog, so I can document and share the whole process. I will be sharing my opinion and knowledge about personal and work projects.

Check out my [About](/about) page for more details!
