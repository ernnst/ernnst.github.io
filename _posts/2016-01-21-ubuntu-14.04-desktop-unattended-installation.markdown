![Ubuntu Installation](/assets/images/2016/ubuntu_1.png)

There are two most commonly used methods when it comes to automating Ubuntu installations: Preseed and Kickstart. The first one is an official method for Ubuntu to suppress all the questions in the installation process, but it has really steep learning curve if you are making automatic Ubuntu installer for the first time. Second method is really easy to start with because Ubuntu supports most of the RedHat's Kickstart options, but since it isn't an official method, we are still going to use some Preseed commands.

I couldn't find one tutorial where the whole process would be explained, so I made this fully working and tested[^1] tutorial for anyone to use.

In this tutorial I am going to create Kickstart and Preseed configuration files, modify original Ubuntu ISO files, save my modified ISO and make USB Startup Disk from it.

## 1. Create Kickstart Configuration File
Install Kickstart by typing this command into Terminal:

    sudo apt-get install system-config-kickstart

After the installation process is completed, open Kickstart Configurator using Unity search or just by typing `system-config-kickstart` in Terminal.

When the Kickstart opens, choose the settings you need for your installation. You can review all possible options on the official Kickstart Configurator [documentation site](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/5/html/installation_guide/ch-redhat-config-kickstart). Here is the configuration I used:


![Kickstart Configurator](/assets/images/2016/ubuntu_2.png)

Very basic and self explanatory settings here. I used x86 architecture, because my devices had less than 4 GB of RAM.

![Kickstart Configurator](/assets/images/2016/ubuntu_3.png)

If you want to install Ubuntu from CD-ROM or USB like I did, choose CD-ROM. If you want to install it from ISO file stored on FTP, HTTP servers or hard drive, choose appropriate options.

![Kickstart Configurator](/assets/images/2016/ubuntu_4.png)

Keep boot loader options to default.

![Kickstart Configurator](/assets/images/2016/ubuntu_5.png)

Be careful on this step and set the right partitioning information, because it can completely delete your current system. I installed Ubuntu on machines that had the same size HDDs with existing partitions. I just wanted to delete everything.
Make sure to create <code>/boot</code>, <code>/</code> and <code>swap</code> partitions. In this example the first two partitions are in fixed size and the last one is set to fill all remaining space for <code>swap</code>.

![Kickstart Configurator](/assets/images/2016/ubuntu_6.png)

Choose Static or DHCP.

![Kickstart Configurator](/assets/images/2016/ubuntu_7.png)

Kept the default settings.

![Kickstart Configurator](/assets/images/2016/ubuntu_8.png)

Enter your credentials. You can later change the password in <code>ks.cfg</code> file manually. If you chose to encrypt your password, the supported hash in Kickstart configuration is MD5. Use Open SSL command <code>openssl passwd -1 *yourpassword*</code> in Terminal to generate the new password.

![Kickstart Configurator](/assets/images/2016/ubuntu_9.png)

Keep it disabled. Ubuntu doesn't support firewall settings.

![Kickstart Configurator](/assets/images/2016/ubuntu_10.png)

Do not configure the X Window System here. Ubuntu automatically solves this one anyway.

![Kickstart Configurator](/assets/images/2016/ubuntu_11.png)

Ubuntu doesn't support Kickstart package selection. We'll add them manually to <code>%packages</code> section in <code>ks.cfg</code> file.

![Kickstart Configurator](/assets/images/2016/ubuntu_12.png)

Write anything that you need to do before starting Kickstart installation.

![Kickstart Configurator](/assets/images/2016/ubuntu_13.png)

Write anything that you need to do after Kickstart installation. It executes the script in <code>chroot</code> environment, so you don't need to use <code>sudo</code>.

When you are finished with the configuration, press File > Save File in the top menu. Keep default file name as `ks.cfg` and save it to your Desktop.

Here are the contents of my `ks.cfg` file:

    #Generated by Kickstart Configurator

    # Add your custom post installation script here. It's not necessary, but you can add something depending on your needs. Here's my script:
    %post
    # Turn on automatic login for user ernestas.
    sed -i '/#  AutomaticLogin/ s/^#  //;s/user1/ernestas/g' /etc/gdm/custom.conf

    # Define variables for Gnome settings file.
    settingsDir=/usr/share/glib-2.0/schemas
    settingsFile=gnome-tweaks.gschema.override
    settingsFileWithDir=$settingsDir/$settingsFile

    # Create a file for Gnome settings, which will later be compiled in this script.
    touch $settingsFileWithDir

    # Enable VNC
    echo "[org.gnome.Vino]" >> $settingsFileWithDir
    echo "authentication-methods=['vnc']" >> $settingsFileWithDir
    echo "enabled=true" >> $settingsFileWithDir
    echo "require-encryption=false" >> $settingsFileWithDir
    echo "prompt-enabled=false" >> $settingsFileWithDir
    echo "vnc-password='bXVjaGhhY2tlcndvdw=='" >> $settingsFileWithDir

    # Turn off screen lock
    echo "" >> $settingsFileWithDir
    echo "[org.gnome.desktop.screensaver]" >> $settingsFileWithDir
    echo "lock-enabled=false" >> $settingsFileWithDir

    # Turn off screen timeout
    echo "" >> $settingsFileWithDir
    echo "[org.gnome.desktop.session]" >> $settingsFileWithDir
    echo "idle-delay=0" >> $settingsFileWithDir

    # Change default favorite applications
    echo "[org.gnome.shell]" >> $settingsFileWithDir
    echo "favorite-apps=['google-chrome.desktop','gnome-terminal.desktop','nautilus.desktop']" >> $settingsFileWithDir

    # Compile Gnome settings
    glib-compile-schemas $settingsDir

    # Turn on Wake-on-LAN
    ethtool -s eth0 wol g

    # Enable shutdown and updates for ernestas without password
    echo "" >> /etc/sudoers
    echo "#Custom rules" >> /etc/sudoers
    echo "ernestas ALL = NOPASSWD: /sbin/shutdown" >> /etc/sudoers
    echo "ernestas ALL = NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/apt-get" >> /etc/sudoers

    # Install Google Chrome
    wget https://dl.google.com/linux/direct/google-chrome-stable_current_i386.deb
    dpkg -i google-chrome-stable_current_i386.deb

    # Delete Chrome install
    rm google-chrome-stable_current_i386.deb

    # Clean
    apt-get -f -y install
    apt-get -y autoremove
    apt-get clean

## 2. Create Preseed file
Pressed commands work when they are directly written inside the Kickstart file, but I wanted to separate the two methods for you to see clear boundaries between them. Create new file name `ubuntu-auto.seed` and include the following contents:

    # Unmount drives with active partitions. Without this command all the installation process would stop and require confirmation to unmount drives that are already mounted.
    d-i preseed/early_command string umount /media || true

    # Don't install recommended items
    d-i preseed base-installer/install-recommends boolean false

    # Install only security updates automatically
    d-i preseed pkgsel/update-policy select unattended-upgrades

For additional Preseed configuration options, refer to official Ubuntu installation [guide](https://help.ubuntu.com/lts/installation-guide/i386/apb.html).

## 3. Extract original ISO file

Download Ubuntu Server 14.04.3 from [Ubuntu website](http://www.ubuntu.com/download/server). It is necessary to use server version, because desktop version doesn't support unattended installations. Desktop functionality will work after we install `ubuntu-desktop` package in `%packages` section.

Mount .iso file to Ubuntu filesystem using Terminal. The command below will mount .iso file to the folder named *ubuntu_iso* on your desktop.

    cd Desktop
    mkdir ubuntu_iso
    sudo mount -o loop ~/Downloads/ubuntu-14.04.3-server-i386.iso ubuntu_iso

Copy .iso contents to another folder on your desktop so we can edit the files. Don't forget to set the right permissions to be able to make changes.

    mkdir ubuntu_files
    sudo rsync -a ubuntu_iso/ ubuntu_files/
    sudo chmod -R 755 ubuntu_files
    sudo chown -R ernestas:ernestas ubuntu_files

## 4. Edit contents of ISO
Copy `ks.cfg` and `ubuntu-auto.seed` files to newly created `ubuntu_files` folder.

Now we need to make the installer read Kickstart and Preseed files by including new menu selection for automatic Ubuntu installation. To do this, open file named `txt.cfg` in `isolinux` folder using your favorite text editor and copy this block of text after the line `default install`:

    label autoinstall
      menu label ^Automatically install Ubuntu
      kernel /install/vmlinuz
      append file=/cdrom/preseed/ubuntu-server.seed vga=788 initrd=/install/initrd.gz ks=cdrom:/ks.cfg preseed/file=/cdrom/ubuntu-auto.seed quiet --

Turn off language choice menu and specify your desired language:

    echo en >>ubuntu_files/isolinux/lang

You can also use text editor for this. Just create the file named `lang` with the contents `en` and save it to `isolinux` folder.

## 5. Recreate ISO file and make bootable USB media

Create new ISO:

    $ cd ubuntu_files
    $ mkisofs -D -r -V “ubuntu-auto” -cache-inodes -J -l -b isolinux/isolinux.bin -c isolinux/boot.cat -no-emul-boot -boot-load-size 4 -boot-info-table -o ~/Desktop/ubuntu-auto.iso .

Create bootable USB media using Ubuntu Startup Disk Creator from newly created `ubuntu-auto.iso` file :

![Startup Disk Creator](/assets/images/2016/ubuntu_14.png)

After booting into USB, you should see something like this:

![Grub Menu](/assets/images/2016/ubuntu_1.png)

Press Enter and relax! The whole process will be seen as below, but you won't need to do anything.
